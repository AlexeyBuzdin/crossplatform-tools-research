#### (RUS) Разработка кросплатформенного решения для мобильных устроиств

#### Thesis description:
With a deversity of platforms and devices available in Mobile and Web, the major problem of code and resource reuse between platforms is as crucial as ever. Thesis will dive into modern Cross-platform solutions in a pros and cons approach using different platform rules and benchmarking approaches that will be investigated during the thesis. As a result a common set of benchmarks will be developed and used for the comparisson. During the development phase of the thesis, a personal Cross-platform solution will be developed and tested using a test suite created on the earlier stages of cross-platform tool comparisson.  

#### Thesis Goal:
Create a Cross-platform development solution that will support Android and iOS platforms and measure its performance using a set of cross-platform benchmarks.
